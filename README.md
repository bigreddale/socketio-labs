# Socket.IO Labs

## 1. Simple Client/Server

Two directories contain a skeleton simple client and server,
called, unsurprisingly:
    - simple-client
    - simple-server

Complete the TODO items in the code.

When you have finished, test Socket.IO:

1. Start the server.
1. Call the `sendMessageToServer` function:

    ```
    sendMessageToServer('hello server');
    ```

Verify that the message is displayed by the server in its console.

## Using Socket.IO with Hapi.js

1. The directory 'chat-server-express' contains
   a chat server, but it is written in _express_.
   - Convert it into Hapi.
   - Test it with multiple browser windows.
